Created multiple C# console projects using the .NET CLI (dotnet new console)

Understood project vs folder structure (.csproj, Program.cs, multiple projects in one repo)

Used Console.ReadLine() and handled nullable input with string?

Validated user input (null, whitespace, invalid ranges)

Used if / else if / else correctly and learned why condition order matters

Worked with arrays (string[] and int[])

Generated random values using Random.Next

Filled arrays using for loops and foreach

Learned why foreach gives values, not indexes

Built strings using interpolation ($"...")

Fixed type mismatch errors (int vs string, arrays vs single values)

Used Thread.Sleep() to control execution timing

Created and called methods properly in top-level programs

Committed multiple projects to Git with meaningful messages

Pushed code to GitHub correctly

Learned how .gitignore works for .NET projects

Navigated directories correctly using cd
